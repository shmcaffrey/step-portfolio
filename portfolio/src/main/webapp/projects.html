  <h2>2019-2020</h2>
  <h3>21st Century Hammond Organ</h3>
  <p>
    With a team of two other Computer Science students, two Electrical engineering students, and a Mechanical
    engineering student, we've embarked on a mission to create a <a href="https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/2020-ae/">
    21st century organ</a>. Through The University of Michigan <a href="https://artsengine.engin.umich.edu/">Arts
    Engine program</a> and Multidisiplinary Design Program (MDP), I suggested a 21st century organ is an organ anyone
    can play, even if you don't know anything about music. We're currently in our mid-year break and will resume
    work in the fall.

  <h2>2019</h2>
  <h3>Euchre</h3>
  <p>In partnership with another CS student, we  coded the Michigan card game Euchre using inheritance in C++.
    I sppecifically helped to make sure we met mini deadlines we'd set for ourselves along with partner coding.
    and took the lead on testing and version control</p>
  <h2>2018</h2>
  <h3>Arduino: Space Invaders</h3>
    In a group of 4 women coders, we recreated the classic 'Space Invaders' using an Arduino and screen.
    Players would use a potentiometer to move their space ship and a button to fire against invaders.
  <h3>Arduino: Fall Down!</h3>
  <p> As an extention to the Space Invaders project, my  team recreated the popular app 'Fall Down!' using
    an Arduino and potentiometer. Players would move a ball through platforms which scrolled up the screen at
    an increasing speed. I contributed to the code design, testing, version control, and finding a bug that gave
    us inconsistent results.</p>
